       "'Proteins were eluted from washed beads by adding 2-fold-concentrated SDS-gel sample loading buffer and heating to 80°C for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Novex gel (10% Bis-Tris SDS gel; Life Technologies/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and run about 1/3 of the length of the lane. The lanes were cut out and stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon Ltd., Harston, United Kingdom) in separate trays until bands were just visible. The area covering the bands was cut into 5 to 6 slices, which were washed, reduced, and alkylated and treated with trypsin according to standard procedures. Peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid–50% acetonitrile, dried down, and redissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). For liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, a sample aliquot was applied via a nanoAcquity (Waters, Manchester, United Kingdom) ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system running at a flow rate of 250 nl min−1 to an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Peptides were trapped using a precolumn (Symmetry C18, 5 μm, 180 μm by 20 mm; Waters), which was then switched in-line to an analytical column (BEH C18, 1.7 μm, 75 μm by 250 mm; Waters) for separation. Peptides were eluted with a gradient of 3 to 40% acetonitrile in water–0.1% formic acid at a rate of 0.67% min−1. The column was connected to a 10-μm SilicaTip nanospray emitter (New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) attached to a nanospray interface (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) for infusion into the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode at a capillary temperature of 200°C. The source voltage and focusing voltages were tuned for the transmission of Met-Arg-Phe-Ala (MRFA) peptide (m/z 524) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Data-dependent analysis was carried out in orbitrap-ion trap parallel mode using collision-induced fragmentation (CID) on the 6 most abundant ions in each cycle. The orbitrap was run with a resolution of 30,000 over the MS range from m/z 350 to m/z 1,800 and an MS target of 106 and 1-s maximum scan time. Collision energy was 35, and an isolation width of 2 was used. Only monoisotopic 2+ and 3+ charged precursors were selected for MS2 fragmentation stage. The MS2 was triggered by a minimal signal of 1,000 with an automatic gain control target of 3 × 104 ions and 150-ms scan time using the chromatography function for peak apex detection. Dynamic exclusion was set to 1 count and 60-s exclusion with an exclusion mass window of ±20 ppm. MS scans were saved in profile mode, while MS/MS scans were saved in centroid mode.'"

       "'Generation of mDia2-Based Immunocomplexes and Mass Spectrometry 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged full-length mDia2 (either the wild type or the MA mutant) or empty vector. Cell lysates were prepared as previously described (7, 19). One and a half milligrams of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag M2® Affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours at 4°C. Beads were washed three times in NET buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 5 mM NaF and 1 mM NaVO4. Proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen)). The gel was fixed and stained with Colloidal Blue according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).   Mass Spectrometry Protein reduction and alkylation was performed in gel with DTT (56°C, 1 h) and 2-chloro-iodoacetamide (dark, RT, 30 min), respectively, after which digestion was performed with trypsin over night at 37°C. Peptides were extracted with 100% ACN. The samples were analysed on an LTQ Orbitrap or LTQ OrbitrapVelos instrument (Thermo Scientific, Bremen) connected to an Agilent 1200 HPLC system. The nanoLC was equipped with a 20 mm 100 µm i.d.Reprosil C18 trap column and a 400 mm 50 µm i.d.Reprosil C18 analytical column (Dr Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) all packed in-house. Solvent A consisted of 0.1M acetic acid (Merck) in deionized water (Milli-Q, Millipore), and solvent B consisted of 0.1M acetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (Biosolve). Trapping was performed at a flow of 5 µl/min for 10 min and the fractions were eluted using a flow rate passively split to either 100 nl/min (60 min LC method) or 50 nl/min (90 min LC method). The gradient used was: 90 min LC method, 10 min solvent A; 13-28% solvent B in 45 min; 28-50% solvent B in 10 min; 50-100% solvent B in 3 min; 100% solvent B for 1 min; 20 min solvent A. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode and in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS. For the Orbitrap analysis the three most intense ions in the survey scan (350 to 1500 m/z, resolution 60, 000, AGC target 5e5) were fragmented in the linear ion trap (AGC target 1e4), and for the OrbitrapVelos analysis the five most intense ions in the survey scan (350 to 1500 m/z, resolution 30, 000, AGC target 5e5) were subjected to HCD fragmentation (resolution 7,500, AGC target 3e4), with the normalized collision energy set to 35% for both CID and HCD. The signal threshold for triggering an MS/MS event was set to 500 counts. For internal mass calibration the 445.120025 ion was used as lock mass with a target lock mass abundance of 0%. The low mass cut-off for HCD was set to 180 m/z. Charge state screening was enabled, and precursors with unknown charge state or a charge state of 1 were excluded. Dynamic exclusion was enabled (exclusion size list 500, exclusion duration 25 s).'"

       "'Frozen plant material was ground with a mortar and pestle. To 0.75 g fresh weight plant material, 3 ml of cold native protein extraction buffer was added. Proteins were extracted on ice for 20 min and the extracts were cleared afterwards by centrifugation at 4�C for 15 min at 16 200x g. To the pellet 1.5 ml of urea buffer was added at RT and the pellet was resuspended by vortexing. Proteins were extracted at RT for another 20 min, followed by centrifugation at RT for 10 min at 16 200x g. The supernatant was collected in dialysis bags and the urea concentration was reduced in a two-step dialysis to about 10 mM urea with a two-step dialysis. First, 500 �g protein in a total volume of 800 �l was pre-cleared with 100 �l washed sepharose CL4B under constant agitation for 2 h. Afterwards the sepharose was pelleted and half of the extract was added to 50 �l washed p62-derived UBA domain agarose conjugate, while the other half was added to 50 �l sepharose CL4B as a control. After incubation for 2 h under agitation the beads were pelleted, the supernatant was removed and the beads were washed 3 times. Proteins were eluted and subjected directly to SDS PAGE on 10% gels. After electrophoretic separation of the proteins, each lane was cut into 5 sections. Proteins were reduced with DTT followed  by carbamidomethylation with iodacetamide.  The proteins were then digested in-gel with trypsin solution for 16-19 h at 30�C. After digestion, the peptides were extracted and acetonitrile was vaporised before the peptides were desalted using Sep-Pak reverse-phase cartridges. Before subjection to mass spectrometric measurements, each sample was dissolved in 3% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectrometry measurements were performed on an LTQ OrbiTrap XL MS (Thermo Fisher) coupled to a NanoLC-AS1 (Eksigent) using electrospray ionisation. For LC separation a capillary column packed with 8 cm C18 beads with a diameter of 3 �m and a pore size of 100 � was used. Peptides were loaded on the column with a flow rate of 500 nl/min for 16 min and eluted by an increasing acetonitrile gradient from 3% acetonitrile to 50% acetonitrile for 60 min with a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Full scans were obtained using the FT Orbitrap at a range of 300-2000 mass/charge followed by MS/MS scans of the five highest parent ions. Dynamic exclusion was enabled at a duration of 120 s.'"
